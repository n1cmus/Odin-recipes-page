      <li>8 skinless chicken drumsticks</li>
      <li>200ml milk</li>
      <li>hot sauce optional</li>
      <li>200g self-raising flour</li>
      <li>2 tsp onion granules</li>
      <li>2 tsp garlic granules</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground white pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>6 - 8 tbsp groundnut oil</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the chicken in a bowl and pour over <br>the milk adding the hot sauce if you choose to use it. Season the milk with<br> salt. Tip the flour and spices into a large plastic bag and add a tsp of <br>salt and a good grinding of pepper.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Heat half the oil in a large frying pan. Take half of the chicken out of the<br> milk, shake off any excess and put in the bag of seasoned flour. Hold the top<br> closed and shake well. Lift the pieces out and shake off any excess, but <br>don’t do this too hard or you’ll end up with no coating. Lower the pieces <br>into the oil and fry for a few minutes on each side until golden and crisp <br>– don’t overdo it as the chicken is being baked next and will brown further.<br> Use tongs to turn the chicken and try not to tear the coating. Transfer to <br>a rack set in a roasting tin. Repeat with the rest of the chicken.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bake for 30 mins until cooked – check one drumstick and one thigh with a <br>skewer – cook for longer if you need to.</p>
      </li>
